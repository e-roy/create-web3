A boilerplate for starting a web3 project.

This boilerplate quickly creates a mono repo with 2 environments, a Next JS environment for front-end and a Hardhat environment for writing, testing and deploying contracts.

## Quick Start Notes

1.  Run `npx create-web3` to start install
2.  Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install all the dependencies
3.  Once installation is complete, `cd` into your app's directory and run `yarn chain` or `npm run chain` to start a local hardhat environment
4.  Open another terminal and `cd` into your app's directory
5.  Run `yarn deploy` or `npm run deploy` to deploy the example contract locally
6.  Run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to start your Next dev environment
