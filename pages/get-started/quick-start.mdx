import { Code } from "../../components";

# Quick Start

First start by opening your terminal and typing :

<Code>npx create-web3</Code>

1. Name your project.

2. Choose install by using NPM or YARN

3. Choose project create with Javascript or Typescript

When finished now install packages

<Code terminal>install</Code>

Once packages are installed `cd` into the directory of your project

To start your local hardhat environment:

<Code terminal>chain</Code>

Now open another terminal, `cd` into the directory of your project, and deploy the Greetor.sol contract

<Code terminal>deploy</Code>

Now in the same terminal start your Front End:

<Code terminal>dev</Code>

import Callout from "nextra-theme-docs/callout";

<Callout emoji="ðŸš€">
  Now open your browser and go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
</Callout>

### Congratulations!!!

### You've just setup your local development environment and deployed a contract locally

You can now connect a wallet and interact with the Greeter contract by typing in a new message.
