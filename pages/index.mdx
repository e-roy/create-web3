### Welcome ðŸ˜ƒ

ðŸ§± & ðŸš€ more

Setting up a project takes a lot of time, so I created `create-web3` to help others quickly get a starting point to either test an idea or build their dapp.

I hope this helps you get up and going quickly and so you can focus on creating something great! ðŸ˜ƒ

This guide is a work in progress

### Version

Current Version [![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ankr.com/ankr.js)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ankr.com/ankr.js)

When using `npx create-web3` you are saving this package locally on your machine. To check the current version on your machine

<Code>npx @ankr.com/ankr.js --version</Code>

To install the latest version

<Code>npm i @ankr.com/ankr.js</Code>

### Overview

This project was created as a quick start boilerplate for developing web3 apps and deploying smart contracts.

The bolierplate sets up a monorepo that keeps the front-end environment and the contract environment seperate from each other.
The advantage to setting up in this way, is that packages and libraries are kept seperate, and reduces clutter when developing.

The goal of this boilerplate is to give you the options of frameworks and quickly set up a lean starting point to test or build an idea.
