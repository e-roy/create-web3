# Create Web3

### Welcome 😃

This guide is a work in progress

### Overview

This project was created as a quick start boilerplate for developing web3 apps and deploying smart contracts.

The bolierplate sets up a monorepo that keeps the front-end environment (NextJS) and the contract environment (Hardhat) seperate from each other.
The advantage to setting up in this way, is that packages and libraries are kept seperate, and reduces clutter when developing.

The bolierplate does NOT include any CSS frameworks. There too many opinonated views on which framework to use, it's better that YOU, the user, decides what you like working with best.

### Technologies

This project is built with the following open source libraries, frameworks and languages.
