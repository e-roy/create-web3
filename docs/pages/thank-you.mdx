# Thank You

The goal of this project together to get a better understanding for creating, deploying and working with contracts in connection to a Front End.

The focus was to create a quick, lightweight starting point to test an idea or create an dapp without spending a lot of time on setup.

I wanted to give thanks to those that helped inspire me to understand and create this project, and also to those that put content out there to help others in their journey.
