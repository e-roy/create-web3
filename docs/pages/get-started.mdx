# Getting Started

First start by opening your terminal and typing :

```jsx
npx create-web3
```

1. Name your project.

2. Choose install by using NPM or YARN

3. Choose project create with Javascript or Typescript

When finished now install packages

For NPM type:

```jsx
npm install
```

For YARN type:

```jsx
yarn;
```

Once packages are installed `cd` into the directory of your project

To start your local hardhat environment, run:

for npm

```jsx
npm run chain
```

for yarn

```jsx

```

Now open another terminal, `cd` into the directory of your project, and deploy the Greetor.sol contract

for npm

```jsx
npm run deploy
```

for yarn

```jsx
yarn deploy
```

Now in the same terminal start your Front End by running:
